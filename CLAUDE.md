# Claude Code specifics

The `harness@agentic-harness` plugin supplies the hooks, subagents and skills below; `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` comes with it as a dependency.

## Which skill when

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Starting, resuming or finishing a change; unsure whether to stop | `harness:workflow` |
| New idea or behavior change | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Proposal, archive | `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:archive` (call OpenSpec through `/opsx:*`, not the `openspec-*` skills directly) |
| Implementation plan / execution | `superpowers:writing-plans`, `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` |
| A task or the branch reaches review | `harness:review-loop` |
| A new guardian test | `harness:mutation-check` |
| Harness version update | `harness:adopt` ("Updating") |

## Subagents

- Dispatch only `harness:implementer` and `harness:reviewer`, and always pass `model: "opus"`. An omitted model inherits the session's.
- The context that implemented something never reviews it. During subagent-driven development the controller distributes, judges and records; it does not write code.
- Agent definition changes take effect only in a new session. The symptom of a stale definition is `No such tool available`.

## Hooks and permissions

- Hooks block destructive commands and secret access, send pushes to `main` and lockfile-changing installs to the PO, lint each edited file, and run tests before the turn ends. They read `HARNESS_*` from `.claude/settings.json` `env`.
- Under auto mode the agent cannot write `.claude/settings.json`. Put the complete new file in the scratchpad and ask the PO to place it.
- A hook refusal is a policy decision, not an obstacle: do not rephrase the command to get around it; ask the PO.

## Long and unattended runs

- `/goal <completion condition> or stop after N turns`; always give a turn limit.
- Headless: `claude -p --permission-mode auto --permission-prompts none --max-turns N`. Prompting operations are denied and skipped; list them in the final report.

## Compact instructions

Always keep: the change name and Issue number, the worktree path and branch, the ledger path (`.superpowers/sdd/<plan>/progress.md`), completed tasks and the current task number, the latest review verdict and open Critical / Important findings, PO decisions and unanswered questions, and the test / lint commands. Drop tool output bodies, exploratory file contents and full subagent reports into summaries.

## Portfolio specifics（portfolio 固有）

- このマシン固有の癖（sandbox は `settings.local.json` で無効、1Password 署名、`gh` の複数アカウント、worktree セッションの git ガード、Playwright MCP の保存先）は `docs/harness/README.md` §3
- UI レビューの preview は `pnpm build && pnpm preview`（`http://127.0.0.1:4321/`）。implementer に戻す前に `pnpm exec astro preview stop`（e2e がポートを使う）
